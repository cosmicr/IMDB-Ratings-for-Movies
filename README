The default movie scraper, themoviedb, is lacking in the ratings. IMDB contains much better ratings for movies.

This script when run will go through your movie library and update the movies ratings whilst keeping all the other meta data from themoviedb.

Note: This script is not affiliated in any way with IMDB, use it at your own risk.
