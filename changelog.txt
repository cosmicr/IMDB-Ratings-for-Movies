[B]Version 2.0[/B]

Now working in Frodo.
Complete re-write using XBMC's JSON RCP API.
Script now uses omdbapi.com instead of the actual IMDB site, unfortunately this means no more top250 votes for now.

Added progress meter, and warning for larger libraries. 
Still a bit more cleanup of code to do.
